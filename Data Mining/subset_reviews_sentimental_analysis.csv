"International Rescue Committee","IRC considers itself as a Humanitarian Organization  but this is far from truth.Long story short  this organization has zero ethical considerations at the very core  upward  and downward.IRC complaint system is incompetent  and below professional standard.HR Regional and Country Office are only facades  and lack integrity  so do not be fooled by the high salary.","Very efficient HR  but only at the on boarding stage!IRC worships process but that process mostly fails.","1"

"Autonomous Intelligent Driving GmbH","Until now I haven´t experienced any.","Multi-cultural english-speaking company  fully supported by Audi AG but with the mindset and agility of a start-up. Modern installations in the center of Munich and lots of daily benefits (fruit  coffee  chocolates  napping room  co-working areas  etc). Every employee is very good equipped (big screens  powerful computers) and the canteen is awesome. They also organize several after-work events and grills in the rooftop terrace. And everybody shares the same sense of culture and mission  which is very good. Top management is very open and accessible to all.","5"
"BNP Paribas","Low salaries compared to competitors. Limited mentorship or professional development opportunities. Repetitive work.Promotions without pay increases. They'll change your job title and expect you to assume additional responsibilities and stress for no additional pay. Management will make you promises that they can't keep. Management is consistently cost cutting through all the means.. There never seems to a budget for anything  no team bonding activities  summer barbecues  which is hard to believe when you work with the 8th largest bank in the world by AUM.","Work is not stressful. Young and fun team.","2"
"Autonomous Intelligent Driving GmbH","- Poor management not taking responsibility and ownership- Too many managers for a startup developing a product- Communication and severe misalignment across teams (this is generating a deep sensation of chaos)- Technology stack is definitely far from state of the art- Technical role descriptions are not aligned with the reality and this generates frustration and dissatisfaction among employees- There's no such thing as career path or progression- Despite there are several Agile coachers still in an early stages of Agile embracement- No performance KPI's defined or applied- Too many graduated and a few experienced engineers.","- Nice and relaxed working environment- Amazing work/life balance between- Very good salaries","2"

"Autonomous Intelligent Driving GmbH","No cons to mention so far.","Even as a candidate I had a very good experience with AID during the recruitment process: it was very smooth  efficient  and whenever I had any questions/ concerns the hiring team was very responsive and acted quickly to find solutions.Now as an employee I got to know that AID has a great company culture  building up a very agile  dynamic and international team  where the employees truly believe in the product that they are developing","5"
"Autonomous Intelligent Driving GmbH","nothing really  besides the downsides of a young start-up company (=if you like being told exactly what to do and following processes  this might be not the right place for you)","- start-up atmosphere- great/fun colleagues- a lot of autonomy and trust from management- exciting field (possibility to shape the future way of mobility)- 1st class laptop  personal phone and other equipment- professional recruitment process where I always felt appreciated- free drinks  fresh fruits  sweets in the office and subsidised cantina for lunch","5"

"comSysto","not really a lot to mention here. As I worked there the company was fast growing and they had issues to keep up with the structure and communication. But a normal process I guess.","You will work with very good people   from which you can learn a lot. Additionally  for example as a dev  you will have people with concentration on big data  UX and devOps around  which will give you another perspective on things and directions to evolve. You can freely chose the kind of formation you would like  also if it is not necessary for your current job.  A nice place for curious people who want to keep moving.","5"

Auch mit den Geschäftsführern kann man sehr gut und unkompliziert Ideen oder Probleme besprechen. Agiles und selbstständiges Arbeiten wird hier groß geschrieben. Wer sich weiterentwickeln möchte muss nur mit Kollegen sprechen und bekommt für gewöhnlich die Möglichkeit sich zu entfalten. Bei regelmäßigen Firmentreffen kommt man mit allen Mitarbeitern zusammen  kann sich austauschen und erfährt was es neues im Unternehmen gibt.Zusammengefasst kann man sagen: TOP","5"
